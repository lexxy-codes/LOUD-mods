# lexxy-codes LOUD mod collection
A collection of mods for Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (LOUD mod) developed by lexxy-codes, standing on the shoulders of modders who came before me.

# For players - installation
1. Download this repository as a zip file. (Press code->download ZIP)
2. Extract the mod folders (the folders next to this readme) into your LOUD "usermods" folder. For default installations, this is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\LOUD\usermods`
The mods will appear in your mod selection list when creating a game.

# The mods
## Jukebox
> [!CAUTION]
> Jukebox mod requires a pre-release version of LOUD. The music will not play on the current public release.

Jukebox allows you to customize the background music in the game which you hear during builds and battles. Create your own custom playlists by selecting multiple jukebox-enabled mods together at the same time. Adding any other music mods not specifically developed to be jukebox compatible are likely to not work as you'd expect.
- Jukebox_FA            - Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, select to include the base game music in your playlist
- Jukebox_SC            - Supreme Commander OST
- Jukebox_SC2           - Supreme Commander 2 OST
- Jukebox_TA            - Total Annihilation OST
- Jukebox_PhilCrofts    - Phillip Crofts self composed music for Forged Alliance (find him at https://soundcloud.com/phillip-crofts)
